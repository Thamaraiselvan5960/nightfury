<h1>How to use paramiko to execute commands on Remote Server?</h1>

<h1>What is Paramiko?</h1>
<p>It's a python third party module and which is uesd to connect with your remote server to execute commands, transfer files from local to remote or remote to local.</p>

<h1>Cofigurations to use Paramiko:</h1>
<li>Install paramiko if it's not in your host. </li>
<li>Make sure that SSHD service is up and running in your remotr server.</li>
<li>Make sure PasswordAuthentication is yes in SSHD_config file in your remote server.By default PasswordAuthentication is 'No'.</li>
<li>Get username, password and hostname of your remote server.</li>

<li>ligin to your server manually and change PasswordAuthentication yes to get file by enter below command</li>

<h1>Step1:</h1>
<p>If you are going to connect to your remote server first time it ask as like below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">ECDSA key fingerprint is **************
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
</code></pre>
<p>type 'yes' to continue.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import paramiko
#required data to coonect to your remote server
user_name = "ubuntu" #here ubuntu is my server name
password = "******"
ip = "3.141.1.124"
port = "22"
pkey = paramiko.RSAKey.from_private_key_file("C:\\Users\\THAMARAI\\tomtheevilcat1.pem")

#use Either password or pkey option

print ("Connection Process Initiated ...")
ssh_client = paramiko.SSHClient()

#this step enables fingerprint for first time login
ssh_client.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())

#to connect to your server
ssh_client.connect(hostname = ip, username = user_name, password = password)

print ("Connected to Server...")
cmd = 'ls -la'
stdin,stdout,stderr = ssh_client.exec_command(cmd)

print (stdout.read().decode())
